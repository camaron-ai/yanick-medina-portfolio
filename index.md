## Projects in Data Science, Machine Learning and Computer Science

### Mars Spectrometry: Detect Evidence for Past Habitability 2022, hosted by DrivenData and NASA
I participated in the Mars Exploration Challenge, where participants were tasked to detect families of chemical compounds in mass spectrometry data. Despite the complexity of the task, I achieved 5th place by engineering hundreds of features from raw mass spectrometry data to train gradient boosting machine models. Additionally, I used data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to train large machine-learning models with less than 1000 training examples.

### Advent of Code 2022
I have taken on the challenge of solving daily coding problems from Advent of Code 2022.
Every day, I approach a new problem and work to find the most efficient solution. On my GitHub, I provide a clear explanation, along with the time and space complexity and its implementation using Python3.
